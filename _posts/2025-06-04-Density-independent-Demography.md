In the preceding chapter, we listed Hastings’ (A. Hastings 2011) key principles and assumptions of single species population growth. One of the key assumptions is that “all individuals in a population are identical.” In this chapter, we elucidate an important violation of that assumption, population structure.

## Fertility

The other half of the life table is the fertility column, $b_x$. Here, each value represents the average number of female offspring produced per female of a given age. Again, gathering accurate data on fertility in the field is problematic for many populations. In order to simplify calculations, we count only the number of females. That is, the values are mean numbers of females by age class. Fertility, similar to survivorship, can be graphed as a function of age, and the resultant fertility curve is usually triangular or rectangular in shape. 

The sum of the $b_x$ column defines the gross reproductive rate (GRR). This number is the average number of female offspring produced by a female that survives at least through the last reproductive age class
$$
    GRR = \sum {b_x}
