What determines whether a particular geographic region will be a tropical forest, a grassy plain, or a barren landscape of sand dunes? ? The aspect of the physical environment that most influences a particular ecosystem by placing the greatest constraint on organisms is climate. Weather is the combination of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloudiness, and other atmospheric conditions occurring at a specific place and time. Climate is the long-term average pattern of weather and may be local, regional, or global.

## Surface Temperatures

It is the difference between the incoming shortwave (solar) radiation and outgoing longwave (terrestrial) radiation that defines the net radiation and determines surface temperatures.

There is a distinct latitudinal gradient of decreasing net surface radiation from the equator toward the poles. This decline is a direct function of the variation with latitude in the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the surface. Two factors influence this variation. First, at higher latitudes, solar radiation hits the surface at a steeper angle, spreading sunlight over a larger area. Second, solar radiation that penetrates the atmosphere at a steep angle must travel through a deeper layer of air. In the process, it encounters more particles in the atmosphere, which reflect more of the shortwave radiation back into space.

The result of the decline in net radiation with latitude is a distinct gradient of decreasing mean annual temperature from the equator toward the poles.

## Surface Temperatures Vary Seasonally

Although the variation in shortwave (solar) radiation reaching Earth’s surface with latitude can explain the gradient of decreasing mean annual temperature from the equator to the poles, it does not explain the systematic variation occurring over the course of a year. 

Earth, like all planets, is subject to two distinct motions. While it orbits the Sun, Earth rotates about an axis that passes through the North and South Poles, giving rise to the brightness of day followed by the darkness of night (the diurnal cycle). Earth travels about the Sun in an ecliptic plane. By chance, Earth’s axis of spin is not perpendicular to the ecliptic plane but tilted at an angle of 23.5°. As a result, as Earth follows its elliptical orbit about the Sun, the location on the surface where the Sun is directly overhead at midday migrates between 23.5° N and 23.5° S latitude over the course of the year.

At the vernal equinox (approximately March 21) and autumnal equinox (approximately September 22), the Sun is directly overhead at the equator. At this time, the equatorial region receives the greatest input of shortwave (solar) radiation, and every place on Earth receives the same 12 hours each of daylight and night.

At the summer solstice (approximately June 22) in the Northern Hemisphere, solar rays fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° N). This is when days are longest in the Northern Hemisphere, and the input of solar radiation to the surface is the greatest. In contrast, the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter at this time. 

At winter solstice (about December 22) in the Northern Hemisphere, solar rays fall directly on the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° S). This period is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas the Northern Hemisphere is enduring shorter days and colder temperatures. Thus, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.

## Global Patterns of Atmospheric Circulation

Note from the global map of mean annual net radiation presented below that there are regions of positive (surplus) and negative (deficit) net radiation.

In fact, there is a distinct latitudinal pattern of surface radiation illustrated below.

Between 35.5° N and 35.5° S (from the equator to the midlatitudes), the amount of incoming shortwave radiation received over the year exceeds the amount of outgoing longwave radiation and there is a surplus. In contrast, from 35.5° N and S latitude to the poles (90° N and S), the amount of outgoing longwave radiation over the year exceeds the incoming shortwave radiation and there is a deficit. This imbalance in net radiation sets into motion a global scale pattern of the redistribution of thermal energy (heat) from the equator to the poles. The primary mechanism of this planetary transfer of heat from the tropics (region of net radiation surplus) to the poles (region of net radiation deficit) is the process of convection, that is, the transfer of heat through the circulation of fluids (air and water). The resulting convergence of winds from the north and south in the region of the equator is called the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, for short.

If Earth were stationary and without irregular landmasses, the atmosphere would circulate as shown above. Earth, however, spins on its axis from west to east. Although each point on Earth’s surface makes a complete rotation every 24 hours, the speed of rotation varies with latitude (and circumference). At a point on the equator (its widest circumference at 40,176 km), the speed of rotation is 1674 km per hour. In contrast, at 60° N or S, Earth’s circumference is approximately half that at the equator (20,130 km), and the speed of rotation is 839 km per hour. According to the law of angular motion, the momentum of an object moving from a greater circumference to a lesser circumference will deflect in the direction of the spin, and an object moving from a lesser circumference to a greater circumference will deflect in the direction opposite that of the spin. As a result, air masses and all moving objects in the Northern Hemisphere are deflected to the right (clockwise motion), and in the Southern Hemisphere to the left (counterclockwise motion).
