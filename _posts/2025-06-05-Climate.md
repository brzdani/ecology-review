What determines whether a particular geographic region will be a tropical forest, a grassy plain, or a barren landscape of sand dunes? ? The aspect of the physical environment that most influences a particular ecosystem by placing the greatest constraint on organisms is climate. Weather is the combination of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloudiness, and other atmospheric conditions occurring at a specific place and time. Climate is the long-term average pattern of weather and may be local, regional, or global.

It is the difference between the incoming shortwave (solar) radiation and outgoing longwave (terrestrial) radiation that defines the net radiation and determines surface temperatures.
