What determines whether a particular geographic region will be a tropical forest, a grassy plain, or a barren landscape of sand dunes? ? The aspect of the physical environment that most influences a particular ecosystem by placing the greatest constraint on organisms is climate. Weather is the combination of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloudiness, and other atmospheric conditions occurring at a specific place and time. Climate is the long-term average pattern of weather and may be local, regional, or global.
