What determines whether a particular geographic region will be a tropical forest, a grassy plain, or a barren landscape of sand dunes? ? The aspect of the physical environment that most influences a particular ecosystem by placing the greatest constraint on organisms is climate. Weather is the combination of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloudiness, and other atmospheric conditions occurring at a specific place and time. Climate is the long-term average pattern of weather and may be local, regional, or global.

## Surface Temperatures

It is the difference between the incoming shortwave (solar) radiation and outgoing longwave (terrestrial) radiation that defines the net radiation and determines surface temperatures.

There is a distinct latitudinal gradient of decreasing net surface radiation from the equator toward the poles. This decline is a direct function of the variation with latitude in the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the surface. Two factors influence this variation. First, at higher latitudes, solar radiation hits the surface at a steeper angle, spreading sunlight over a larger area. Second, solar radiation that penetrates the atmosphere at a steep angle must travel through a deeper layer of air. In the process, it encounters more particles in the atmosphere, which reflect more of the shortwave radiation back into space.

The result of the decline in net radiation with latitude is a distinct gradient of decreasing mean annual temperature from the equator toward the poles.

## Surface Temperatures Vary Seasonally

Although the variation in shortwave (solar) radiation reaching Earth’s surface with latitude can explain the gradient of decreasing mean annual temperature from the equator to the poles, it does not explain the systematic variation occurring over the course of a year. 

Earth, like all planets, is subject to two distinct motions. While it orbits the Sun, Earth rotates about an axis that passes through the North and South Poles, giving rise to the brightness of day followed by the darkness of night (the diurnal cycle). Earth travels about the Sun in an ecliptic plane. By chance, Earth’s axis of spin is not perpendicular to the ecliptic plane but tilted at an angle of 23.5°. As a result, as Earth follows its elliptical orbit about the Sun, the location on the surface where the Sun is directly overhead at midday migrates between 23.5° N and 23.5° S latitude over the course of the year.

At the vernal equinox (approximately March 21) and autumnal equinox (approximately September 22), the Sun is directly overhead at the equator (see Figure 2.7). At this time, the equatorial region receives the greatest input of shortwave (solar) radiation, and every place on Earth receives the same 12 hours each of daylight and night.
