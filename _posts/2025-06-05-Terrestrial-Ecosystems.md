F. E. Clements (Carnegie Institution of Washington) and V. E. Shelford (University of Illinois) introduced an approach for combining the broadscale distribution of plants and associated animals into a single classification system. In their book Bio-ecology, Clements and Shelford referred to these biotic units as biomes. Biomes are classified according to the predominant plant types. There are at least eight major terrestrial biome types, but there may be more, depending on how finely the biomes are classified.

When the plant ecologist Robert Whittaker of Cornell University plotted these biome types on gradients of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, he found they formed a distinctive climatic pattern, as graphed below.
