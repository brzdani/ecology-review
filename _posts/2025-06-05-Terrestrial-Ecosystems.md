F. E. Clements (Carnegie Institution of Washington) and V. E. Shelford (University of Illinois) introduced an approach for combining the broadscale distribution of plants and associated animals into a single classification system. In their book Bio-ecology, Clements and Shelford referred to these biotic units as biomes. Biomes are classified according to the predominant plant types. There are at least eight major terrestrial biome types, but there may be more, depending on how finely the biomes are classified.

When the plant ecologist Robert Whittaker of Cornell University plotted these biome types on gradients of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, he found they formed a distinctive climatic pattern, as graphed below.

On combining the simple classification of plant lifeforms and leaf type with the largescale patterns of climate presented previously, we can begin to understand the distribution of biome types relative to the axes of temperature and precipitation. Ecosystems characteristic of warm, wet climates with no distinct seasonality are dominated by broadleaf evergreen trees and are called tropical (and subtropical) rain forest. As conditions become drier, with a distinct dry season, the broadleaf evergreen habit gives way to droughtdeciduous trees that characterize the seasonal tropical forests. As precipitation declines further, the stature and density of these trees declines, giving rise to the woodlands and savannas that are characterized by the coexistence of trees (shrubs) and grasses. As precipitation further declines, trees can no longer be supported, giving rise to the arid shrublands (thorn scrub) and desert.

The temperature axis represents the latitudinal gradient from the equator to the poles. Moving from the broadleaf evergreen forests of the wet tropics into the cooler, seasonal environments of the temperate regions, the dominant trees are winterdeciduous. These are the regions of temperate deciduous forest. In areas of the temperate region where precipitation is insufficient to support trees, grasses dominate and give rise to the prairies of North America, the steppes of Eurasia, and the pampas of Argentina. Moving poleward, the temperatedeciduous forests give way to the needleleaf–dominated forests of the boreal region (conifer forest or taiga). As temperatures become more extreme and the growing season shorter, trees can no longer be supported, and the shortstature shrubs and sedges (grasslike plants of the family Cyperaceae) characteristic of the tundra dominate the landscape ecosystems of the arctic region.

Main points: 
- The equatorial zone between latitudes 10° N and 10° S
- Warm throughout the year and rainfall occurs almost daily
- High year-round, averaging 25–29°C with little seasonal variation.
- a minimum monthly precipitation above 60 millimeters.
- In tropical rain forests, rainfall is relatively constant, about 200–400 cm annually.
- In tropical dry forests, precipitation is highly seasonal, about 150–200 cm annually, with a six- to seven-month dry season.
- The soils of tropical dry forests tend to be less acidic than those of rain forests and are generally richer in nutrients.
- The height of the dry forest is highly correlated with average precipitation.
- As in the tropical rain forest, many plants produce animal-dispersed seeds.
- However, wind-dispersed seeds are also common.
- In the driest habitats, all trees drop their leaves during the dry season; in wetter areas over 50% may be evergreen.
- In fact, animal diversity isTropical Foresthigher in tropical forests than in any other terrestrial biome.
- Many tropical forests are now being cut down and converted to farmland, urban areas, and other types of land use.

## Tropical Savanna

Main points: 
- It is generally applied to a range of vegetation types in the drier tropics and subtropics charcterized by a ground cover of grasses with scattered shrubs or trees.
- Savannas are associated with a warm continental climate with distinct seasonality in precipitation and a large interannual (year to year) variation in total precipitation.
- Most tropical savannas occur north and south of tropical dry forests within 10 8  to 20 8  of the equator. 
- The savanna is warm year-round, averaging 24–29°C.
- There is seasonality in temperatures, and maximum temperatures occur at the end of  the wet season.
- Here, however, seasonal drought combines with another important physical factor, fire.
- The rains come in summer and are accompanied by intense lightning.
- This lightning often starts fires, particularly at the beginning of the wet season when the savanna is tinder dry.
- These fires kill young treesو while the grasses survive and quickly resprout.
- Soil layers with low permeability to water play a key role in maintaining many tropical savannas.
- Continuous weathering in these regions has produced nutrientpoor oxisols, which are particularly deficient in phosphorus.
- A greater proportion of the biological activity on the savanna takes place near ground level.
- The tropical savanna is populated by wandering animals that move in response to seasonal and year-to-year variations in rainfall and food availability.
- Savannas are characterized by a twolayer vertical structure because of the ground cover of grasses and the presence of shrubs or trees.
- The microenvironments associated with tree canopies can influence species distribution, productivity, and soil characteristics.
- The scattered trees found at different densities in the savanna often are thorny and have small leaves, an apparent adaptation to the relatively dry conditions.
-  The dominant herbivores are actually insects, especially termites.
